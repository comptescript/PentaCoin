Penta coin is a new, decentralised, untracable and FAST cryptocurrency.

Privacy: PentaCoin uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain. This ensures that all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

Security: Using the power of a miner network, every transaction on the network is secured. Individual wallets are also secured by a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to PentaCoin's codebase! If you have an idea of code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. If the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.
